# SSNenvSummary
Upstream and downstream stream network environmental summaries for SSN objects

## Installation

The easiest way to install the `SSNenvSummary` package is from within the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) using `remotes::install_github()`. At this time the package has not been published to CRAN so the default `install.packages()` will not work. Instead use remotes (or devtools) to install the package directly from GitHub:
``` r
# You may need to install remotes
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("mattjbayly/SSNenvSummary")
```
